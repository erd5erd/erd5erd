## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Junior Data Analyst and currently looking for a job. Iâ€™ve finished *Data Analyst Bootcamp* course at *Yandex Practicum*. During the course I learned:
- to analyse and visualise data with `Python` and its libraries â€” `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, `Folium`;
- to write `SQL`-queries with any level of diffuculty, using nested queries and window-functions;
- the basics of statistics and probability theory that helps me conduct A/B-tests using the `Python` library `Scipy Stats`;
- to build dashboards in `Tableau Public` and `Dash`.

Over the course I solved several cases in many areas â€” product analytics, fintech, marketing analytics, telecom and geoanalytics. 

Besides that Iâ€™m studying Python instruments for web-parsing and geoanalytics on my own.
